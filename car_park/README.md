Develop a digital analogue of the fleet.
Conditions:
- Different types of transport (cargo, passenger, cargo and passenger) should be represented in the fleet.
- Each vehicle must have its own characteristics, both general (for example, year of manufacture, make and model, type of fuel used, its consumption ...)
and specific (for example, body volume and load capacity for transport carrying cargo, and passenger capacity â€“ for transporting passengers).
- Similarly with the methods: there should be both general (for example, refuel and repair) and specific (for example, disinfect the interior
for buses and seal the body for trucks).
- Trucks should have different types of bodies and, accordingly, different variants of transported goods (for example, industrial goods can be transported in awnings, 
industrial goods and perishable products in refrigerators, liquids in tanks, etc.).
- It is also necessary to provide for the execution of orders for transportation. The order must include the starting and ending points, as well as the volume, 
weight and type of cargo for cargo transportation or the number of passengers for passenger transportation. 
It should be possible to load and unload the order to/from a specific machine. Each vehicle should be able to view
the available load capacity, volume (or number of seats) and orders that are currently loaded into the car.
Development result:
- Object-oriented description of the fleet.
- It is required to simulate the work (create several vehicles, refuel and service them, load/unload several orders).
